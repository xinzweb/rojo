Create a new folder, then run rojo init inside that folder to initialize an empty project. mkdir my-new-project cd my-new-project rojo init Rojo will make a small project file in your directory, named default.project.json . It'll make sure that any code in the directory src will get put into ReplicatedStorage.Source . Speaking of, let's make sure we create a directory named src , and maybe a Lua file inside of it: mkdir src echo 'print(\"Hello, world!\")' > src/hello.lua Building Your Place \u00b6 Now that we have a project, one thing we can do is build a Roblox place file for our project. This is a great way to get started with a project quickly with no fuss. All we have to do is call rojo build : rojo build -o MyNewProject.rbxl If you open MyNewProject.rbxl in Roblox Studio now, you should see a Folder containing a ModuleScript under ReplicatedStorage ! Info To generate an XML place file instead, like if you're checking the place file into version control, just use rbxlx as the extension on the output file instead. Live-Syncing into Studio \u00b6 Building a place file is great for the initial build, but for actively working on your place, you'll want something quicker. In Roblox Studio, make sure the Rojo plugin is installed. If you need it, check out the installation guide to learn how to install it. To expose your project to the plugin, you'll need to serve it from the command line: rojo serve This will start up a web server that tells Roblox Studio what instances are in your project and sends notifications if any of them change. Note the port number, then switch into Roblox Studio and press the Rojo Connect button in the plugins tab. Type in the port number, if necessary, and press Start . If everything went well, you should now be able to change files in the src directory and watch them sync into Roblox Studio in real time! Uploading Your Place \u00b6 Aimed at teams that want serious levels of automation, Rojo can upload places to Roblox.com automatically. You'll need an existing place on Roblox.com as well as the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie of an account that has write access to that place. Warning It's recommended that you set up a Roblox account dedicated to deploying your place instead of your personal account in case your security cookie is compromised.

As such, Rojo 0.5.x projects are not compatible with Rojo 0.4.x projects. Supporting Both 0.4.x and 0.5.x Upgrading Your Project File Migrating Unknown Files Supporting Both 0.4.x and 0.5.x \u00b6 Rojo 0.5.x uses a different name for its project format. While 0.4.x used rojo.json , 0.5.x uses default.project.json , which allows them to coexist. If you aren't sure about upgrading or want to upgrade gradually, it's possible to keep both files in the same project without causing problems. Upgrading Your Project File \u00b6 Project files in 0.5.x are more explicit and flexible than they were in 0.4.x. Project files can now describe models and plugins in addition to places. This new project file format also guards against two of the biggest pitfalls when writing a config file: Using a service as a partition target directly, which often wiped away extra instances Defining two partitions that overlapped, which made Rojo act unpredictably The biggest change is that the partitions field has been replaced with a new field, tree , that describes the entire hierarchy of your project from the top-down. A project for 0.4.x that syncs from the src directory into ReplicatedStorage.Source would look like this: { \"name\" : \"Rojo 0.4.x Example\" , \"partitions\" : { \"path\" : \"src\" , \"target\" : \"ReplicatedStorage.Source\" } } In 0.5.x, the project format is more explicit: { \"name\" : \"Rojo 0.5.x Example\" , \"tree\" : { \"$className\" : \"DataModel\" , \"ReplicatedStorage\" : { \"$className\" : \"ReplicatedStorage\" , \"Source\" : { \"$path\" : \"src\" } } } } For each object in the tree, we define metadata and children . Metadata begins with a dollar sign ( $ ), like $className . This is so that children and metadata can coexist without creating too many nested layers. All other values are considered children, where the key is the instance's name, and the value is an object, repeating the process. Migrating Unknown Files \u00b6 If you used Rojo to sync in files as StringValue objects, you'll need to make sure those files end with the txt extension to preserve this in Rojo 0.5.x.

Instance Description \u00b6 Instance Descriptions correspond one-to-one with the actual Roblox Instances in the project. They can be specified directly in the project file or be pulled from the filesystem. $className : The ClassName of the Instance being described. Optional if $path is specified. $path : The path on the filesystem to pull files from into the project. Optional if $className is specified. Paths are relative to the folder containing the project file. $properties : Properties to apply to the instance. Values should be Instance Property Values . Optional $ignoreUnknownInstances : Whether instances that Rojo doesn't know about should be deleted. Optional Default is false if $path is specified, otherwise true .

Folders \u00b6 Any directory on the filesystem will turn into a Folder instance unless it contains an 'init' script, described below. Scripts \u00b6 The default script type in Rojo projects is ModuleScript , since most scripts in well-structued Roblox projects will be modules. If a directory contains a file named init.server.lua , init.client.lua , or init.lua , that folder will be transformed into a *Script instance with the contents of the 'init' file. This can be used to create scripts inside of scripts. For example, these files: Will turn into these instances in Roblox: Localization Tables \u00b6 Any CSV files are transformed into LocalizationTable instances. Rojo expects these files to follow the same format that Roblox does when importing and exporting localization information. Plain Text Files \u00b6 Plain text files ( .txt ) files are transformed into StringValue instances. This is useful for bringing in text data that can be read by scripts at runtime. JSON Models \u00b6 Files ending in .model.json can be used to describe simple models. They're designed to be hand-written and are useful for instances like RemoteEvent . A JSON model describing a folder containing a Part and a RemoteEvent could be described as: { \"Name\" : \"My Cool Model\" , \"ClassName\" : \"Folder\" , \"Children\" : [ { \"Name\" : \"RootPart\" , \"ClassName\" : \"Part\" , \"Properties\" : { \"Size\" : { \"Type\" : \"Vector3\" , \"Value\" : [ 4 , 4 , 4 ] } } }, { \"Name\" : \"SendMoney\" , \"ClassName\" : \"RemoteEvent\" } ] } It would turn into instances in this shape: Binary and XML Models \u00b6 Rojo supports both binary ( .rbxm ) and XML ( .rbxmx ) models generated by Roblox Studio or another tool.

Each of these tools solves what is essentially the same problem from a few different angles. The goal of Rojo is to take all of the lessons and ideas learned from these projects and build a tool that can solve this problem for good. Additionally: I think that this tool needs to be built in a compiled language without a runtime, for easy distribution and good performance. I think that the conventions promoted by other sync plugins ( .module.lua for modules, as well a single sync point) are sub-optimal.

CLI RbxTree In-Memory Filesystem (IMFS) Snapshot Reconciler HTTP API Roblox Studio Plugin CLI \u00b6 RbxTree \u00b6 Rojo uses a library named rbx_tree as its implementation of the Roblox DOM. It serves as a common format for serialization to all the formats Rojo supports! Rojo uses two related libraries to deserialize instances from Roblox's file formats, rbx_xml and rbx_binary . In-Memory Filesystem (IMFS) \u00b6 Relevant source files: server/src/imfs.rs server/src/fs_watcher.rs Rojo keeps an in-memory copy of all files that it needs reasons about. This enables taking fast, stateless, tear-tree snapshots of files to turn them into instances. Keeping an in-memory copy of file contents will also enable Rojo to debounce changes that are caused by Rojo itself. This'll happen when two-way sync finally happens. Snapshot Reconciler \u00b6 Relevant source files: server/src/snapshot_reconciler.rs server/src/rbx_snapshot.rs server/src/rbx_session.rs To simplify incremental updates of instances, Rojo generates lightweight snapshots describing how files map to instances. This means that Rojo can treat file change events similarly to damage painting as opposed to trying to surgically update the correct instances. This approach reduces the number of desynchronization bugs, reduces the complexity of important pieces of the codebase, and makes writing plugins a lot easier. HTTP API \u00b6 Relevant source files: server/src/web.rs The Rojo live-sync server and Roblox Studio plugin communicate via HTTP. Requests sent from the plugin to the server are regular HTTP requests. Messages sent from the server to the plugin are delivered via HTTP long-polling.
